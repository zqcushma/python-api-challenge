Module 6 Challenge for Data Analytics Bootcamp

Created maps and tracked weather utilizing various APIs. Ran into an issue where the created output does not match given output, unsure as to why. This lead to a difference in cities viewed, causing fewer cities to have hotels availible. Traced the issue back to the narrowing of the data, however I am unsure as to what exactly the issue is with the constraints put on the data. However as the constraints listed in the assignment were merely and example, I belive that the code is working alright.
